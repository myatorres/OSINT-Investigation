# OSINT Digital Footprint Investigation  
A hands-on OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) project where I analyze my own digital footprint, showcasing web investigation techniques, privacy risks, and security recommendations.

## Project Overview  
This project demonstrates how publicly available information can be collected and analyzed using OSINT tools. The goal is to evaluate online presence, identify potential risks, and provide actionable security recommendations.

## Features & Key Findings  
- **Social Media Analysis** – Public profile tracking & metadata extraction.
- **Data Breach Investigation** – Checking for leaked credentials (Have I Been Pwned).
- **WHOIS Lookup** – Domain & website registration data analysis.

## Tools & Techniques Used  
- **Have I Been Pwned** – Check for compromised credentials.
- **Google Dorking** – Find publicly available information using search operators.
- **WHOIS Lookup** – Identify domain registration details.
